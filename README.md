# Installation

Clone the repository and use

```bash
pip install -e HARNet/
```

to install the package.

# Usage

Go to the HARNet root directory

```bash
cd HARNet
```

an start single experiments based on one of the preset configuration files

```bash
harnet ./configs/RV/RecField_20/HAR20_OLS.in
harnet ./configs/RV/RecField_20/QLIKE/HARNet20_QLIKE_OLS.in
```

Start experiments for all preset configuration files

```bash
/bin/bash run_all.sh
```

Results and TensorBoards for all experiments are saved in the ./HARNet/results folder.
